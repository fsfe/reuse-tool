### Changed

- Use UTF-8 explicitly when reading files (#242)

### Fixed

- Updated license list to 3.11.

## 0.11.1 - 2020-06-08

### Fixed

- Similar to CAL-1.0 and CAL-1.0-Combined-Work-Exception, SHL-2.1 is now ignored
  because it contains an SPDX tag within itself.

## 0.11.0 - 2020-05-25

### Added

- Added `--skip-unrecognised` flag to `addheader` in order to skip files with
  unrecognised comment styles instead of aborting without processing any file.

### Changed

- Always write the output files encoded in UTF-8, explicitly. This is already
  the default on most Unix systems, but it was not on Windows.

- All symlinks and 0-sized files in projects are now ignored.

### Fixed

- The licenses CAL-1.0 and CAL-1.0-Combined-Work-Exception contain an SPDX tag
  within themselves. Files that are named after these licenses are now ignored.

- Fixed a bug where `addheader` wouldn't properly apply the template on
  `.license` files if the `.license` file was non-empty, but did not contain
  valid SPDX tags.

## 0.10.1 - 2020-05-14

### Fixed

- Updated license list to 3.8-106-g4cfec76.

## 0.10.0 - 2020-04-24

### Added

- Add support for autoconf comment style (listed as m4).

- More file types are recognised:

  - Cython (`.pyx`, `.pxd`)
  - Sass and SCSS (`.sass`, `.scss`)
  - XSL (`.xsl`)
  - Mailmap (`.mailmap`)

- Added `--single-line` and `--multi-line` flags to `addheader`. These flags
  force a certain comment style.

### Changed

- The Docker image has an entrypoint now. In effect, this means running:

  `docker run -v $(pwd):/data fsfe/reuse lint`

  instead of

  `docker run -v $(pwd):/data fsfe/reuse reuse lint`.

## 0.9.0 - 2020-04-21

### Added

- Added support for Mercurial 4.3+.

- A pre-commit hook has been added.

- When an incorrect SPDX identifier is forwarded to `download` or `init`, the
  tool now suggests what you might have meant.

### Changed

- Under the hood, a lot of code that has to do with Git and Mercurial was moved
  into its own module.

- The Docker image has been changed such that it now automagically runs
  `reuse lint` on the `/data` directory unless something else is specified by
  the user.

### Fixed

- Fixed a bug with `addheader --explicit-license` that would result in
  `file.license.license` if `file.license` already existed.

- Fixed a Windows-only bug to do with calling subprocesses.

- Fixed a rare bug that would trigger when a directory is both ignored and
  contains a `.git` file.

## 0.8.1 - 2020-02-22

### Added

- Support Jinja (Jinja2) comment style.

- Support all multi-line comment endings when parsing for SPDX information.

### Fixed

- Improvements to German translation by Thomas Doczkal.

- No longer remove newlines at the end of files when using `addheader`.

- There can now be a tab as whitespace after `SPDX-License-Identifier` and
  `SPDX-FileCopyrightText`.

## 0.8.0 - 2020-01-20

### Added

- Implemented `--root` argument to specify the root of the project without
  heuristics.

- The linter will complain about licenses without file extensions.

- Deprecated licenses are now recognised. `lint` will complain about deprecated
  licenses.

- ProjectReport generation (`lint`, `spdx`) now uses Python multiprocessing,
  more commonly called multi-threading outside of Python. This has a significant
  speedup of approximately 300% in testing. Because of overhead, performance
  increase is not exactly linear.

- For setups where multiprocessing is unsupported or unwanted,
  `--no-multiprocessing` is added as flag.

- `addheader` now recognises many more extensions. Too many to list here.

- `addheader` now also recognises full filenames such as `Makefile` and
  `.gitignore`.

- Added BibTex comment style.

- Updated translations:

  - Dutch (André Ockers, Carmen Bianca Bakker)
  - French (OliBug, Vincent Lequertier)
  - Galician (pd)
  - German (Max Mehl)
  - Esperanto (Carmen Bianca Bakker)
  - Portuguese (José Vieira)
  - Spanish (Roberto Bauglir)
  - Turkish (T. E. Kalayci)

### Changed

- The linter output has been very slightly re-ordered to be more internally
  consistent.

- `reuse --version` now prints a version with a Git hash on development
  versions. Towards that end, the tool now depends on `setuptools-scm` during
  setup. It is not a runtime dependency.

### Removed

- `lint` no longer accepts path arguments. Where previously one could do
  `reuse lint SUBDIRECTORY`, this is no longer possible. When linting, you must
  always lint the entire project. To change the project's root, use `--root`.

- `FileReportInfo` has been removed. `FileReport` is used instead.

### Fixed

- A license that does not have a file extension, but whose full name is a valid
  SPDX License Identifier, is now correctly identified as such. The linter will
  complain about them, however.

- If the linter detects a license as being a bad license, that license can now
  also be detected as being missing.

- Performance of `project.all_files()` has been improved by quite a lot.

- Files with CRLF line endings are now better supported.

## 0.7.0 - 2019-11-28

### Changed

- The program's package name on PyPI has been changed from `fsfe-reuse` to
  `reuse`. `fsfe-reuse==1.0.0` has been created as an alias that depends on
  `reuse`. `fsfe-reuse` will not receive any more updates, but will still host
  the old versions.

- For users of `fsfe-reuse`, this means:

  - If you depend on `fsfe-reuse` or `fsfe-reuse>=0.X.Y` in your
    requirements.txt, you will get the latest version of `reuse` when you
    install `fsfe-reuse`. You may like to change the name to `reuse` explicitly,
    but this is not strictly necessary.

  - If you depend on `fsfe-reuse==0.X.Y`, then you will keep getting that
    version. When you bump the version you depend on, you will need to change
    the name to `reuse`.

  - If you depend on `fsfe-reuse>=0.X.Y<1.0.0`, then 0.6.0 will be the latest
    version you receive. In order to get a later version, you will need to
    change the name to `reuse`.

## 0.6.0 - 2019-11-19

### Added

- `--include-submodules` is added to also include submodules when linting et
  cetera.

- `addheader` now also recognises the following extensions:

  - .kt
  - .xml
  - .yaml
  - .yml

### Changed

- Made the workaround for `MachineReadableFormatError` introduced in 0.5.2 more
  generic.

- Improved shebang detection in `addheader`.

- For `addheader`, the SPDX comment block now need not be the first thing in the
  file. It will find the SPDX comment block and deal with it in-place.

- Git submodules are now ignored by default.

- `addheader --explicit-license` now no longer breaks on unsupported filetypes.

## 0.5.2 - 2019-10-27

### Added

- `python3 -m reuse` now works.

### Changed

- Updated license list to 3.6-2-g2a14810.

### Fixed

- Performance of `reuse lint` improved by at least a factor of 2. It no longer
  does any checksums on files behind the scenes.

- Also handle `MachineReadableFormatError` when parsing DEP5 files. Tries to
  import that error. If the import is unsuccessful, it is handled.

## 0.5.1 - 2019-10-24 [YANKED]

This release was replaced by 0.5.2 due to importing
`MachineReadableFormatError`, which is not a backwards-compatible change.

## 0.5.0 - 2019-08-29

### Added

- TeX and ML comment styles added.

- Added `--year` and `--exclude-year` to `reuse addheader`.

- Added `--template` to `reuse addheader`.

- Added `--explicit-license` to `reuse addheader`.

- `binaryornot` added as new dependency.

- Greatly improved the usage documentation.

### Changed

- `reuse addheader` now automatically adds the current year to the copyright
  notice.

- `reuse addheader` preserves the original header below the new header if it did
  not contain any SPDX information.

- `reuse addheader` now correctly handles `.license` files.

- Bad licenses are no longer resolved to LicenseRef-Unknown<n>. They are instead
  resolved to the stem of the path. This reduces the magic in the code base.

- `.gitkeep` files are now ignored by the tool.

- Changed Lisp's comment character from ';;' to ';'.

## 0.4.1 - 2019-08-07

### Added

- `--all` argument help to `reuse download`, which downloads all detected
  missing licenses.

### Fixed

- When using `reuse addheader` on a file that contains a shebang, the shebang is
  preserved.

- Copyright lines in `reuse spdx` are now sorted.

- Some publicly visible TODOs were patched away.

## 0.4.0 - 2019-08-07

This release is a major overhaul and refactoring of the tool. Its primary focus
is improved usability and speed, as well as adhering to version 3.0 of the REUSE
Specification.

### Added

- `reuse addheader` has been added as a way to automatically add copyright
  statements and license identifiers to the headers of files. It is currently
  not complete.

- `reuse init` has been added as a way to initialise a REUSE project. Its
  functionality is currently scarce, but should improve in the future.

### Changed

- `reuse lint` now provides a helpful summary instead of merely spitting out
  non-compliant files.

- `reuse compile` is now `reuse spdx`.

- In addition to `Copyright` and `©`, copyright lines can be marked with the tag
  `SPDX-FileCopyrightText:`. This is the new recommended default.

- Project no longer depends on pygit2.

- The list of SPDX licenses has been updated.

- `Valid-License-Identifier` is no longer used, and licenses and exceptions can
  now only live inside of the LICENSES/ directory.

### Removed

- Removed `--ignore-debian`.

- Removed `--spdx-mandatory`, `--copyright-mandatory`, `--ignore-missing`
  arguments from `reuse lint`.

- Remove `reuse license`.

- GPL-3.0 and GPL-3.0+ (and all other similar GPL licenses) are no longer
  detected as SPDX identifiers. Use GPL-3.0-only and GPL-3.0-or-later instead.

### Fixed

- Scanning a Git directory is a lot faster now.

- Scanning binary files is a lot faster now.

## 0.3.4 - 2019-04-15

This release should be a short-lived one. A new (slightly
backwards-incompatible) version is in the works.

### Added

- Copyrights can now start with `©` in addition to `Copyright`. The former is
  now recommended, but they are functionally similar.

### Changed

- The source code of reuse is now formatted with black.
- The repository has been moved from <https://git.fsfe.org/reuse/reuse> to
  <https://gitlab.com/reuse/reuse>.

## 0.3.3 - 2018-07-15

### Fixed

- Any files with the suffix `.spdx` are no longer considered licenses.

## 0.3.2 - 2018-07-15

### Fixed

- The documentation now builds under Python 3.7.

## 0.3.1 - 2018-07-14

### Fixed

- When using reuse from a child directory using pygit2, correctly find the root.

## 0.3.0 - 2018-05-16

### Changed

- The output of `reuse compile` is now deterministic. The files, copyright lines
  and SPDX expressions are sorted alphabetically.

### Fixed

- When a GPL license could not be found, the correct `-only` or `-or-later`
  extension is now used in the warning message, rather than a bare `GPL-3.0`.
- If you have a license listed as `SPDX-Valid-License: GPL-3.0-or-later`, this
  now correctly matches corresponding SPDX identifiers. Still it is recommended
  to use `SPDX-Valid-License: GPL-3.0` instead.

## 0.2.0 - 2018-04-17

### Added

- Internationalisation support added. Initial support for:
  - English.
  - Dutch.
  - Esperanto.
  - Spanish.

### Fixed

- The license list of SPDX 3.0 has deprecated `GPL-3.0` and `GPL-3.0+` et al in
  favour of `GPL-3.0-only` and `GPL-3.0-or-later`. The program has been amended
  to accommodate sufficiently for those licenses.

### Changed

- `Project.reuse_info_of` now extracts, combines and returns information both
  from the file itself and from debian/copyright.
- `ReuseInfo` now holds sets instead of lists.
  - As a result of this, `ReuseInfo` will not hold duplicates of copyright lines
    or SPDX expressions.
- click removed as dependency. Good old argparse from the library is used
  instead.

## 0.1.1 - 2017-12-14

### Changed

- The `reuse --help` text has been tidied up a little bit.

### Fixed

- Release date in change log fixed.
- The PyPI homepage now gets reStructuredText instead of Markdown.

## 0.1.0 - 2017-12-14

### Added

- Successfully parse old-style C and HTML comments now.
- Added `reuse compile`, which creates an SPDX bill of materials.
- Added `--ignore-missing` to `reuse lint`.
- Allow to specify multiple paths to `reuse lint`.
- `chardet` added as dependency.
- `pygit2` added as soft dependency. reuse remains usable without it, but the
  performance with `pygit2` is significantly better. Because `pygit2` has a
  non-Python dependency (`libgit2`), it must be installed independently by the
  user. In the future, when reuse is packaged natively, this will not be an
  issue.

### Changed

- Updated to version 2.0 of the REUSE recommendations. The most important change
  is that `License-Filename` is no longer used. Instead, the filename is
  deducted from `SPDX-License-Identifier`. This change is **NOT** backwards
  compatible.
- The conditions for linting have changed. A file is now non-compliant when:
  - The license associated with the file could not be found.
  - There is no SPDX expression associated with the file.
  - There is no copyright notice associated with the file.
- Only read the first 4 KiB (by default) from code files rather than the entire
  file when searching for SPDX tags. This speeds up the tool a bit.
- `Project.reuse_info_of` no longer raises an exception. Instead, it returns an
  empty `ReuseInfo` object when no reuse information is found.
- Logging is a lot prettier now. Only output entries from the `reuse` module.

### Fixed

- `reuse --ignore-debian compile` now works as expected.
- The tool no longer breaks when reading a file that has a non-UTF-8 encoding.
  Instead, `chardet` is used to detect the encoding before reading the file. If
  a file still has errors during decoding, those errors are silently ignored and
  replaced.

## 0.0.4 - 2017-11-06

### Fixed

- Removed dependency on `os.PathLike` so that Python 3.5 is actually supported

## 0.0.3 - 2017-11-06

### Fixed

- Fixed the link to PyPI in the README.

## 0.0.2 - 2017-11-03

This is a very early development release aimed at distributing the program as
soon as possible. Because this is the first release, the changelog is a little
empty beyond "created the program".

The program can do roughly the following:

- Detect the license of a given file through one of three methods (in order of
  precedence):
  - Information embedded in the .license file.
  - Information embedded in its header.
  - Information from the global debian/copyright file.
- Find and report all files in a project tree of which the license could not be
  found.
- Ignore files ignored by Git.
- Do some logging into STDERR.
