reuse-lint
==========

Synopsis
--------

**reuse lint** [*options*]

Description
-----------

:program:`reuse-lint` verifies whether a project is compliant with the REUSE
Specification located at `<https://reuse.software/spec>`_.

Criteria
--------

These are the criteria that the linter checks against.

Bad licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Licenses that are found in ``LICENSES/`` that are not found in the SPDX License
List or do not start with ``LicenseRef-`` are bad licenses.

Deprecated licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Licenses whose SPDX License Identifier has been deprecated by SPDX.

Licenses without file extension
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These are licenses whose file names are a valid SPDX License Identifier, but
which do not have a file extension.

Missing licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A license which is referred to in a comment header, but which is not found in
the ``LICENSES/`` directory.

Unused licenses
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A license found in the ``LICENSES/`` directory, but which is not referred to in
any comment header.

Read errors
~~~~~~~~~~~

Not technically a criterion, but files that cannot be read by the operating
system are read errors, and need to be fixed.

Files without copyright and license information
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Every file needs to have copyright and licensing information associated with it.
The REUSE Specification details several ways of doing it. By and large, these
are the methods:

- Placing tags in the header of the file.
- Placing tags in a ``.license`` file adjacent to the file.
- Putting the information in the ``REUSE.toml`` file.
- Putting the information in the ``.reuse/dep5`` file. (Deprecated)

If a file is found that does not have copyright and/or license information
associated with it, then the project is not compliant.
